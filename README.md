# dots

Various dotfiles for my Linux machines

## Install

*Be sure to run these commands from the repo's top dir!*

```

Show what changes are going to be made:

```

## Notes

- The icons I use are generated by Oomox to `~/.icons` and then symlinked to `/usr/share/icons`
- I use a swedish layout with some minor mods, so for most people the kmonad config should be removed/altered
