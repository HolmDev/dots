## Notes

- The icons I use are generated by Oomox to `~/.icons` and then symlinked to `/usr/share/icons`
- I use a swedish layout with some minor mods, so for most people the `.Xmodmap` and parts of `.xprofile` in the `xorg` package should be removed/altered
- The `sxhkdrc` in `dk` and `config.py` in `qtile` contains keybinds for people using `blackwidowcontrol` to enable macro keys on Razer keyboards. Certain multimedia keys may malfunction if used on other keyboards
